# Product-extractor
NER algorithm built on top of Spacy's implementation adapted for furniture shops

train_model.py is used in order to train the NER model found in "product extraction".
The model has already been trained using data from training data which has been extracted using get_text_from_links.py
test.py can run straight from the command line in order to obtain the entities which are identified as produtcs from the data extracted 
from the links which are to be found in the .csv file
