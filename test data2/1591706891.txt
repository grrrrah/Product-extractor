DESCRIPTION

MATERIAL
Hammocks aren't just an oasis for adults, children also need a calm and relaxing environment in which to rest, relax, develop and grow.
Your child will love having their very own chair hammock and space to call their own.
Designed especially for the needs and safety of your child. With its closed suspension system you can rest easy knowing your child is safe and relaxed in their hammock chair.
Whilst using a hammock the soft swinging motion will also help stimulate your child's sense of balance, playfully promoting brain development. Recommended for children by the German Federal Association for the Promotion of Posture and Physical (BAG).
Made from pure soft cotton in an appealing rainbow stripe colour.
Cotton. Made from high quality cotton, that is smooth and soft to the touch, durable and easy cleaning.
Child-friendly hammock chair. Designed especially for the needs of children.
Made from soft high quality long fibre cotton creating a strong, durable and easy to clean product.
Integrated 360° safety swivel. Allowing multi-direct turning without twisting hammock suspension cords.
Recommended by the German Posture and Physical Exercise Association and safety tested by GS-Prüfung to the highest safety standards.
