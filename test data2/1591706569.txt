What Our Customers Say
Nothing makes us happier than helping our clients find joy in their space.
Thank you for working with me to create my favorite room in the house! The desk, bench and bed fit together so well and I couldn't be happier.

I have nothing but great things to say about the purchasing, delivery and quality from Bella cottage. I was nervous about buying chairs sight on seen but Heather worked with me to get pictures of the chairs in production to ensure they would work in our room. We've been furnising a full house and this is one of the few standouts of the last year.

Hi, I just wanted to let you know that the furniture I purchased from you, 3-piece sectional, and 8 dining chairs, and vintage French cane bed are all fantastic and more than I had expected. It was a pleasure to do business with you and I am looking forward to purchasing more items when I move into our new house.
