ZAVEDO
SOHO50-BLK
$69.00
DESCRIPTION
The SOHO HOOK is part of Zavedo's first self-designed Collection, called The Wall Collection. This is a collection of wall products that combines our appreciation for refined, practical, versatile and timeless design. For us detail, quality of material and engineering precision is key in this line.
SOHO HOOK is a sophisticated, minimalist hook designed to hold your jacket, coat, robe, towel, apron, or any home object that needs to be hung or displayed with a little style.  For use in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, reception, retail and commercial spaces.
The hook is a 2 piece construction with a base and a cap. The base is screwed into a wall, door or cabinet with a supplied counter sunk square head screw.  The cap threads onto the base to hide the screw.
The grooved edge detailing is more than aesthetic, its purpose is to provide extra grip for items that would be draped over the edge.
DESIGN IDEAS
Mix and match colours and diameters for a look random look.
Use 3 for balance and harmony.
The SOHO 50 can be used for cabinetry pullers or for a dramatic effect use the SOHO 100.
Use the SOHO 50 to hold shopping bags in any retail environment so you can display your brand with a touch of class and have the bags easily accessible.
