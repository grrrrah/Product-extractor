CH24 Soft chair - Special edition
Description
Available limited time only.
Build your own collection with the CH24 Soft, a gentle variation on Hans J. Wegner’s Wishbone Chair from 1950.
Just like the original, the special edition is timelessly elegant with its clean and characteristic expression. The CH24 Soft has an irresistible matte finish, available on five of our classic colours: black, grey, write, green and red.
The new finish has an inviting quality that tempts the gaze to follow along the backrest and your hand to do the same. Furthermore the coating makes it easier to maintain the chair, keeping the timeless design looking even cleaner
Think of CH24 Soft as a gentle counterpart to a Wishbone Chair with a brighter finish. Or maybe as a subtle contrast to Hans J. Wegner’s CH327 dining table in soap-treated beech.
Technical Info
Dimensions: W:55 x D:51 x H:76cm (Seat height: 45cm)Produced in beech with seat woven with 120 m of paper cord that lasts up to 50 years before replacement.For instructions and information about care and maintenance of Carl Hansen's different materials, please click here.For more options on this Carl Hansen chair please contact one of our stores.
