Cylindrical statement lighting from the Los Angeles-based Feldman Company. Their sculptural pieces spanned a broad spectrum of mid-century trends, including modernism, the so-called “brutalist” aesthetic, and Hollywood Regency. This large-scale pendant lamp has a fiberglass diffuser, surrounded by a decorative grate with a repeating starburst motif. Molded brass rings frame the pendant at either end. We have four lamps available, and the listed price is per item.
Condition: Excellent vintage condition; professionally cleaned.
Dimensions: 13” diameter x 30” height
