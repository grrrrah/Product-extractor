Valda Sofa with Ottoman - Vapour Review Sofa is comfortable and cool, suitable for Singapore's weather as compared to leather sofa which traps heat longer when you sit down for a prolonged period of time.

Nice and of good quality The chat via their webpage was a convenient option to get in touch with the team. And response was fast. The product is quite nice and of good quality. The delivery admin did her best to get me a delivery slot which suited my timing upon my request. Delivery guys were punctual and professional. Installed the table in a fuss free manner. Thanks!
