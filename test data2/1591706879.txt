Nelson Saucer Bubble Pendant
The Nelson Bubble Lamps are an assortment of lamps in various spherical silhouettes that emit an even quality of light. The wide shape of the Nelson Saucer Bubble Pendant, along with the gently flowing lines of its steel understructure bring a lovely shape and soft light into any interior. This pendant light is available in small, medium, large, and extra-large sizes. George Nelson first designed the series in 1952, when he came across a Swedish hanging lamp that he wanted to acquire for his office. He was challenged by the expensive price, which led to him making his own Bubble Lamp series.
Designed by George Nelson, produced by Herman Miller®
