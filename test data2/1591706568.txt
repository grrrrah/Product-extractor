Finer Details
Dimensions
+
55.0” L × 29.5” D × 29.0” H
Materials
+
Legs, trestles and stretcher: FSC certified solid ash wood
Tabletop: Honeycomb core + FSC certified ash veneer
Paint: GREENGUARD certified finish
All of our ash wood is sourced from sustainably managed forests and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Like all natural materials, ash wood inherently differs in color and grain pattern. Each Eave Desk will display its own unique variances, which may include knots, lines, color difference, tiger grain, color variation or shadows. All of these are expected and valued characteristics of natural wood.
The Eave Desk is painted with a safe, non-toxic finish that is GREENGUARD certified, meaning it has been independently tested to meet the world’s most stringent standards for low chemical emissions. This helps ensure healthier air quality inside your space.
Care
+
Dust with a soft dry cloth. If necessary, wet a soft cloth with warm, soapy water and wipe gently. Avoid harsh cleaning agents and abrasive pads. Always follow the wood grains and dry immediately after cleaning.
Avoid placing in direct sunlight, excessive heat or humidity for sustained periods of time.
Shipping
+
Free shipping offered in the U.S. (contiguous 48 states). Eave typically arrives in 2-5 business days. The next run of Eaves in Natural and Fjord Blue is estimated to ship in late July 2020.

Amazing Customer Service
My desk packaging arrived in really bad shape to the point that it was missing vital pieces to assemble the desk because they fell out during transportation. I contacted Dims customer service and they got in touch with pretty quickly, considering we are in a global pandemic. Russ went over and beyond and made sure I got all the pieces that I needed to assemble my desk in a timely manner.
The desk is really well made and it is a great addition to my home office. I would buy more products from Dims in the future.

Solid, well made and pleasant to use
The Eave desk is just what I wanted - a fresh, clean space for working - sewing, computer, all of it. I had no trouble putting it together - all parts (not many) fit perfectly and the bolts were easy to put in place. I had to get my sister to help me turn it on its' legs - because it's too heavy for one person. I finished the top with the nice oil that came in a separate package, and it was not at all unpleasant. Totally good experience, and I recommend this desk/table without reservation.

Perfect Desk for Me
Love the simplicity and clean lines of this desk. It fits in well with multiple syles of decor, rather than competing with it. Sturdy and solid.
